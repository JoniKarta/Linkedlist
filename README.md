# Implementation of linked list

In this project i implemented the ADT of a linked list from scratch.

## Prerequisites

knowledge in c programming and basic understanding of pointers.

## What inside
 
 1. Check if the linked list is empty.
 2. Create empty list.
 3. Method to create new node.
 4. Insert node to the head of linked list.
 5. Insert node to the tail of the linked list.
 6. Display linked list in-order.
 7. Display linked list recursively in reverse order.
 8. Insert Node to linked list by position.
 9. Count the number of nodes in given linked list.
10. Count the number of nodes in given linked list recursively.
11. Find a node in given linked list by it's data.
12. Find a node in given linked list by it's data- version improved.
13. Find the maximum value in a given linked list
14. Find the maximum value in a given linked list recursively
15. Find the middle node in a given linked list
16. Initialized a linked list with a given array.
 
### How to run the code

1. Open the Terminal, then mark the file as executable with the chmod command
```
chmod u+x LinkedList.c 
```

2. Enter make command
```
make 
```

3. Execute by entering the command
```
./linlst
```
